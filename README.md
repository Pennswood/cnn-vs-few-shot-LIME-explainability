# cnn-vs-few-shot-LIME-explainability
In this CMSPC 497 Honors Option project, we seek to provide blackbox explanability to CNN models and Few Shot Learning models. We hypothesized that a meta-learning few-shot learning model mays have better explanability compared to CNN even if it is less acurate because it actually needs to learn intrinsic logic.
